Beautiful images and a great purpose. But then again, it's a feel-good type of ask. No matter if it's publicly or privately funded, there's a sense of awe and discovery in reaching for the stars and recalling the wondrous stories that lead us from the Earth to the Moon.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1b5600a3-c516-489c-bffd-acd97ed8f79a.png"> <blockquote><p>Childhood cancer kills more children than any other disease in the United States today, yet treatments designed for a child’s body remain frustratingly out-of-reach. - ACCO</p></blockquote><p>One might rightly ask, "the incidence is so low and pediatric cancer so rare, isn't 4% enough?" The simple answer is no. Childhood cancer receives very little big pharma support (it's not profitable to develop for small/rare conditions) so the overall picture is very much skewed to adult cancers.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3a1f8fe8-2fa2-41cd-bf07-5969448f3523.png"> <p>Just what is a 'moonshot' for cancer research? When you start to dig into what's involved with doing childhood cancer research you quickly see how the deck is stacked against it. I discussed the funding issues above and it doesn't stop there. Access is hard as well - it's difficult for terminal patients to gain access to unapproved treatments that could be promising. As Biden put it, "the science, data, and research results are trapped in silos, preventing faster progress and greater reach to patients. It’s not just about developing game-changing treatments — it’s about delivering them to those who need them." </p><p>I bring up the moonshot for 2 reasons. First - there is something about borrowing the emotion attached to the space race. We've all been touched by cancer. It is emotional. And I would love to use this anger and sadness from the loss of Sawyer and my mom a few years ago and direct it to the future and what can be done. Second - we need goals that feel bigger than what we can do. Skeptics worry that such a goal is unrealistic. So do we strive for less? No way. Do we go in assuming the next 5 years will run perfectly and there will be no cancer in 5 years? Not likely. <b>However, we should be tired of being told why things can't and start wondering how things will become.</b> Luckily many already do have that vision. Realistic goals are needed, but if we don't reach for the stars, we'll never touch them.</p><p>“The Pediatric Cancer MoonShot 2020 is so visionary and, at the same time, has the capacity to disrupt the cancer health care industrial complex,” <a href="https://docs.chocchildrens.org/choc-joins-national-pediatrics-consortium-to-fight-childhood-cancer/">says Dr. Leonard Sender</a>, medical director of the Cancer Institute. “The Cancer MoonShot will attempt to cure all the numerous types of pediatric cancers with the least toxicity by harnessing the patients’ own immune systems and using the tumors’ unique genomic mutations to create individualized cancer vaccines.”</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b7a88724-5147-4970-94f2-c5f0ef105eeb.JPG" alt="" title=""> <p>This is the second of a #3NOTABOUTme series for Sawyer. <a href="https://thegrid.ai/3notaboutme/e6aba2a2-707c-4644-9d01-d68096c44a9b/">Post 1 of 3.</a></p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="45"><!-- react-empty: 46 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-xsmall color-title p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="47"><div class="Component p-1 col-2 col-w-50p ls-w-100p col-gap-0 d-b " data-reactid="48"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="49"><!-- react-empty: 50 --><!-- react-empty: 51 --><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="54"><p data-reactid="55"><span class="linkified" data-reactid="56">I&#x27;m kicking off this blog idea with the worst possible outcome of a story.

I&#x27;ve lost my parents over the past 4 years, my mom to cancer. It&#x27;s a cruel way to be robbed of precious time.

There is nothing but tragedy in this story. I recall at the time praying to understand why my mom had to be taken by cancer...taken before my children were older and would have deep memories of their grandmother. I recall not getting an answer. But thinking there wasn&#x27;t an answer to have, that spending time, in essence meditating on it, was simply a chance for me to get used to the idea - to lessen the sting a bit. It&#x27;s times like this that bring back that bitterness and the only solace I have is the belief that another light has been sent home to shine even brighter and there is no more pain in him.</span></p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="69"><p data-reactid="70"><span class="linkified" data-reactid="71">This magical boy leaves so many touched with love.

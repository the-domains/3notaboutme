A reluctant Post 3 in \#3NOTABOUTme

The first two posts were about a 9 year old boy Sawyer who lost his life to cancer. They were easier to write in a way as the fresh emotions of anger and sadness picked up the pencil for me.

[Post 1 of 3][0]

[Post 2 of 3][1]

This one is difficult as it's the closing post and for a long time I didn't want to write anything. I think it was a metaphor on not being ready to move on. So much has happened since then for Sawyer's family. A memorial, counseling, a new dog the fam had delayed getting (with an awesome name...literally...it's Todd M. Awesome), and lots of pics and videos remembering such an amazing little boy. And sadness.

So I figured the only way to go forward was to look forward. Look at a couple of the amazing resources that touched their lives and a message for those of us who can honor Sawyer by living life.

[Camp Okizu][2] - they provide peer support, respite, mentoring, and recreational programs to meet the needs of all members of families affected by childhood cancer. The kids have received amazing care and support.

[Make-A-Wish Foundation][3] - with a vision to grant the wish of every child diagnosed with a life-threatening medical condition - I think we all know what they do. I wish I could say it's the first child I've seen go through the foundation but he's not. Nevertheless, each child I've seen get a wish have had great memories..

[St. Baldrick's][4] - a charity aimed at finding the most promising research to fund and create funding priorities to make the greatest impact for children with cancer. My last post was on the lack of funding and drugs developed specifically for pediatric cancer - 3 drugs in the last 20 years. St. Baldrick's is looking to change that staggering figure.

[Norbert the Therapy Dog][5] - who's mission is to spread smiles, inspire kindness and bring comfort to those in need. It can be just this simple - the touch and unconditional love of a pet is powerful.

When my mom passed away - we spent time looking at all the wonder that was her life and thought the best way to honor her was to do one of the many things that made her happy. And we have and still do and we think of her often. Sawyer's family has started the same concept in

> \#LiveLikeSoy

Even in the toughest of moments - he chose to live with bravery, with smiles and laughter, with courage and humor and love. Love from and for his family, his friends, his community. We should be so lucky to see as clearly when affected by such a scary situation. So with love, we should all go and meet a challenge, find the hope in things, live with love and \#LiveLikeSoy.

You've changed our hearts and minds forever Sawyer.

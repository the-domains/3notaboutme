I'm kicking off this blog idea with the worst possible outcome of a story. But first, my wish: 
> 
> Can we all spend a little more time using social media to focus on supporting, promoting, and lifting up others? 

Social media's default is that of self-promotion. I think we can use it to highlight those in our lives that inspire us, to highlight causes that are dear to us, to think outside our usual landscape. I'd like to use this blog to do just that and use it to develop other ideas and concepts for people to share what inspires them.

With that simple idea comes this blog 3NOTABOUTme. It's quite simple - with intention, spend time putting out the following:  3 consecutive posts, 3 days of activity, 3 inspiring friends, 3 of anything...and let your followers know more about them and why you want to highlight their story. Act with intention and don't break up the posts. Dedicate some true time to it.

For me, this starts with the worst possible story but one that is wrapped in love amidst the ugliness of terminal childhood cancer. And I'm too mad and sad for a friend to think of anything but this sweet little boy. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/86723fc4-a12d-43ad-825f-a8d73ad5ea83.jpg)

Yes, a sweet, full of life, 9 year old boy lost his battle with cancer today. He was a light in his family. Full of joy. And strong. Not just how he handled the physical fight for his life but how he handled the mental battle at such a young age.

A message he wrote his mom that's now a permanent fixture on her wrist states the simple request he has for her, 
> 
> ## Be brave Mom.

Kelly (and Erin, Ruby, Preston, Charlie, and Rick and Cameo and Greyson and Jude), our hearts cry for you. I've lost my parents over the past 4 years, my mom to cancer. It's a cruel way to be robbed of precious time. And it angers that a 9 year old has to be robbed of so much and a loving family has to be robbed of so much. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6800cd0c-92f0-4521-940f-8fe80021466a.JPG)

And in a bitter irony, to a dear friend Kelly - that someone with so much love in her heart that she dedicated herself to being a surrogate and bringing life into this world for those who could not on their own, that she has to lose a part of her. There is nothing but tragedy in this story. I recall at the time praying to understand why my mom had to be taken by cancer...taken before my children were older and would have deep memories of their grandmother. I recall not getting an answer. But thinking there wasn't an answer to have, that spending time, in essence meditating on it, was simply a chance for me to get used to the idea - to lessen the sting a bit. It's times like this that bring back that bitterness and the only solace I have is the belief that another light has been sent home to shine even brighter and there is no more pain in him.

This magical boy leaves so many touched with love. The community that knew him personally and the community that only knew him through an online network rallied around a disease. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/44db92cc-efa9-460d-b6a9-906e7fab3b7d.jpg)

He loved the Seattle Seahawks. He loved the beach and sea turtles. "Soytown" busted a mean groove and took over a radio station for a day with songs like Uptown Funk. In school he was getting perfect attendance and citizenship awards for strong character. He loved his family so much. He was corny and loved to ham up in front of the camera and was never without a smile.

He is love and he touched the hearts of so many people that are all better off for knowing him.

# Can we all spend a little more time using social media to focus on supporting, promoting, and lifting up others?

Social media's default is that of self-promotion. This isn't to debate the amount that statement is true or how others have used it for good. 

I think we can use it to highlight those in our lives that inspire us, to highlight causes that are dear to us, to think outside our usual landscape. I'd like to use this blog to do just that and use it to develop other ideas and concepts for people to share what inspires them.

With that simple idea comes this blog 3NOTABOUTme. It's quite simple - with intention, spend time putting out the following: 

* 3 consecutive posts on an important topic
* 3 days of activity you want to highlight
* 3 instagram accounts that feed your creativity
* 3 of your friends and how they inspire you
* 3 of anything really!

Let your followers know more about them and why you want to highlight their story. Act with intention and don't break up the posts. Dedicate some true time to it.

<p>And in a bitter irony, to a dear friend Kelly - that someone with so much love in her heart that she dedicated herself to being a surrogate and bringing life into this world for those who could not on their own, that she has to lose a part of her. There is nothing but tragedy in this story. I recall at the time praying to understand why my mom had to be taken by cancer...taken before my children were older and would have deep memories of their grandmother. I recall not getting an answer. But thinking there wasn't an answer to have, that spending time, in essence meditating on it, was simply a chance for me to get used to the idea - to lessen the sting a bit. It's times like this that bring back that bitterness and the only solace I have is the belief that another light has been sent home to shine even brighter and there is no more pain in him.</p><p>This magical boy leaves so many touched with love. The community that knew him personally and the community that only knew him through an online network rallied around a disease. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/44db92cc-efa9-460d-b6a9-906e7fab3b7d.jpg"><p>He loved the Seattle Seahawks. He loved the beach and sea turtles. "Soytown" busted a mean groove and took over a radio station for a day with songs like Uptown Funk. In school he was getting perfect attendance and citizenship awards for strong character. He loved his family so much. He was corny and loved to ham up in front of the camera and was never without a smile.</p><p>He is love and he touched the hearts of so many people that are all better off for knowing him. </p><p>This was the first of a #3NOTABOUTme series. <a href="https://thegrid.ai/3notaboutme/moonshot/">Post 2 of 3</a>.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">3notaboutme</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>

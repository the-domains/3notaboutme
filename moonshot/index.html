Beautiful images and a great purpose. But then again, it's a feel-good type of ask. No matter if it's publicly or privately funded, there's a sense of awe and discovery in reaching for the stars and recalling the wondrous stories that lead us from the Earth to the Moon.</p><p>Then there's the type of moonshot we needed a decade ago for a young 9 year old boy who lost his fight to cancer on Friday. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1b5600a3-c516-489c-bffd-acd97ed8f79a.png"> <p>Using 2014 stats for the purpose of highlighting an issue - The National Cancer Institute's budget for childhood cancer was $195 million. And that seems like a lot until you find out that the overall budget was $4.9 Billion. Only 4% of federal funds were solely dedicated to childhood cancer research. That same year, nearly 16,000 children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 years were diagnosed with cancer and almost 2,000 died of the disease in the United States. Globally, nearly 100,000 die annually. On Friday February 19, Sawyer the Brave was one of them.</p><blockquote><p>Childhood cancer kills more children than any other disease in the United States today, yet treatments designed for a child’s body remain frustratingly out-of-reach. - ACCO</p></blockquote><p>One might rightly ask, "the incidence is so low and pediatric cancer so rare, isn't 4% enough?" The simple answer is no. Childhood cancer receives very little big pharma support (it's not profitable to develop for small/rare conditions) so the overall picture is very much skewed to adult cancers.</p><blockquote><p>Only 3 drugs have been approved specifically for children with cancer in the past 20 years.</p></blockquote><p>...that is, approved in the United States, but that's a different post.  </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3a1f8fe8-2fa2-41cd-bf07-5969448f3523.png"> <p>There is amazing work being done in the field of cancer research, no doubt. But some of the lopsided statistics worked against Sawyer and his very rare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkitt%27s_lymphoma">Refractory Burkitt's Lymphoma</a> - a cancer immune to chemo. Enter Joe Biden. I'd heard about the <a href="https://medium.com/@VPOTUS/inspiring-a-new-generation-to-defy-the-bounds-of-innovation-a-moonshot-to-cure-cancer-fbdf71d01c2e#.xps5qz6vk">Vice President being tasked</a> with creating a moonshot around cancer research but knew nothing of it. </p><p>Just what is a 'moonshot' for cancer research? When you start to dig into what's involved with doing childhood cancer research you quickly see how the deck is stacked against it. I discussed the funding issues above and it doesn't stop there. Access is hard as well - it's difficult for terminal patients to gain access to unapproved treatments that could be promising. As Biden put it, "the science, data, and research results are trapped in silos, preventing faster progress and greater reach to patients. It’s not just about developing game-changing treatments — it’s about delivering them to those who need them." </p><blockquote><p>Right now, only 5 percent of cancer patients in the U.S. end up in a clinical trial. Most aren’t given access to their own data. At the same time, community oncologists — who treat more than 75 percent of cancer patients — have more limited access to cutting-edge research and advances.</p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.cancermoonshot2020.org/">Cancer Moonshot 2020</a> will hopefully increase private and public resources and break down data silos, creating a more collaborative environment, with the goal to double the rate of progress and push 10 years of research into the next 5 years. </p><p>I bring up the moonshot for 2 reasons. First - there is something about borrowing the emotion attached to the space race. We've all been touched by cancer. It is emotional. And I would love to use this anger and sadness from the loss of Sawyer and my mom a few years ago and direct it to the future and what can be done. Second - we need goals that feel bigger than what we can do. Skeptics worry that such a goal is unrealistic. So do we strive for less? No way. Do we go in assuming the next 5 years will run perfectly and there will be no cancer in 5 years? Not likely. <b>However, we should be tired of being told why things can't and start wondering how things will become.</b> Luckily many already do have that vision. Realistic goals are needed, but if we don't reach for the stars, we'll never touch them.</p><p>“The Pediatric Cancer MoonShot 2020 is so visionary and, at the same time, has the capacity to disrupt the cancer health care industrial complex,” <a href="https://docs.chocchildrens.org/choc-joins-national-pediatrics-consortium-to-fight-childhood-cancer/">says Dr. Leonard Sender</a>, medical director of the Cancer Institute. “The Cancer MoonShot will attempt to cure all the numerous types of pediatric cancers with the least toxicity by harnessing the patients’ own immune systems and using the tumors’ unique genomic mutations to create individualized cancer vaccines.”</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b7a88724-5147-4970-94f2-c5f0ef105eeb.JPG" alt="" title=""> <p>Sawyer's Grandfather, affectionately known as "Papa Steve," told of how before Sawyer died, he told his great grandmother via Skype,</p><blockquote><p>I'm gonna save a lot of kids.</p></blockquote><p>As Papa Steve put it, "The heartbreak of his death seems a tiny bit less senseless knowing that this sweetheart of a little boy & dedicated Seahawks fan has touched so many people."  #dontbesorrybeactive #dotherightthing </p> <p>"I'm gonna save a lot of kids." - Yes you will Sawyer!</p><p>This is the second of a #3NOTABOUTme series for Sawyer. <a href="https://thegrid.ai/3notaboutme/e6aba2a2-707c-4644-9d01-d68096c44a9b/">Post 1 of 3.</a></p><p><a href="http://providers.choc.org/findadoc/index.cfm?id=P00348&pid=67&d=Leonard-Sender"></a></p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="32"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="34"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="35"><span data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --><h2 data-reactid="38"><a data-reactid="39">3notaboutme</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="42"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="43"></div></section></div></div>
